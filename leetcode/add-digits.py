"""
Given a non-negative integer num, repeatedly add all its digits
until the result has only one digit.

For example:

Given num = 38, the process is like: 3 + 8 = 11, 1 + 1 = 2.
Since 2 has only one digit, return it.

Follow up:
Could you do it without any loop/recursion in O(1) runtime?

num = 17 => 1 + 7 = 8
num = 489 => 4 + 8 + 9 = 21 => 2 + 1 = 3
