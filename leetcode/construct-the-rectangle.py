"""
For a web developer, it is very important to know how to design a web page's size.
So, given a specific rectangular web pageâ€™s area, your job by now is to design a
rectangular web page, whose length L and width W satisfy the following requirements:

1. The area of the rectangular web page you designed must equal to the given target area.

2. The width W should not be larger than the length L, which means L >= W.

3. The difference between length L and width W should be as small as possible.
You need to output the length L and the width W of the web page you designed in sequence.
