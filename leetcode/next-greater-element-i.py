You are given two arrays (without duplicates) nums1 and nums2 where nums1â€™s
elements are subset of nums2. Find all the next greater numbers for nums1's
elements in the corresponding places of nums2.

The Next Greater Number of a number x in nums1 is the first greater number
to its right in nums2. If it does not exist, output -1 for this number.
