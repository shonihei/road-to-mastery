### The Road to Mastery ###
This is a repository made to keep track of my progress as a computer scientist.
I learn best by 'doing' and so my goal is to learn at least one thing new everyday and actually implement it using this python. The problems I'm solving and the data-structures I'm implementing will hopefully benefit me when I'm applying for jobs, but I find it fun to solve these challenging problems.

I don't know who would read this, but if you were confused by the name of this repository, now you have some context! :)
